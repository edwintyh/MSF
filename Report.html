        <h1>Role Progression of MSF Volunteers</h1>

        <!-- *** Section 1: Key Highlights *** --->
        <h2>Summary of Key Findings</h2>

        <p>Most of the MedCo started their journey with MSF as medical professionals. They subsequently progressed into an intermediate
            role that involves liaison/coordination work before becoming a MedCo. This indicates that MedCo role requires both 
            medical domain knowledge and the ability to lead. </p>
            
        <p>We observe that it takes a long time for a new staff to move from his or her first role into a MedCo position 
             due to skillset mismatch and/or lack of opportunity to acquire new skillset. It is therefore important to create
             opportunities for staffs who are interested in future MedCo roles to acquire required skillsets early so as to reduce the time
             to take up a MedCo role.
        </p>

        <h2>Software / Tools</h2>
        <p>We used python programming language for data processing and visualization. Pandas and Plotly library were used for data transformation
            and visualization respectively

        <!-- *** Section 3: Analysis-->
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <br>
        <p>In our analysis, we are only looking at new staffs which we define as staffs who begin their MSF journey in this operation centre
            i.e. Staff whose first assignment is also their first departure. This selection is made to provide a holistic view of a staff career path from start to end.</p>
        <p>In the following section we came up with analysis that will provide further insights into the questions provided by MSF.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Most Staffs takes on the same roles in consecutive assignments</b></h4>
        <br>
        <iframe width="1200" height="500" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="charts/sankey.html"></iframe>
         <p>The above diagram shows the role change between assignments. The grey lines connecting between different roles represents
             the number of staffs that switched roles between two consecutive assignments. The self-loops represents staffs
             stayed with the same role between two consecutive assignments. For example, a staff who took on an assignment as "Non Medical"
             pool followed by "Project Coordinator" will contribute to the grey line joining "Non Medical" node and "project Coordinator" node.
             The thickness of the grey lines represents the number of transitions between assignments.</p>

        <p>The thick self-loops shows that staffs do not change roles frequently. This might be due to comfort level of the staffs
            or staffs do possess the necessary skills or experience to move to roles that they desire. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><b>53% of the staffs have at least 4 assignments experience before their first MedCo role</b></h4>
        <br>
        <iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="charts/first_medco_assignment_line.html"></iframe>
        <p>The chart above shows the percentage of staffs against the minimum number of assignment experiences they have before taking up 
            their first MedCo role (in the 5th assignment). One staff has up to 16 assignments worth of experience before taking up the MedCo role.
            We would like to raise the question for consideration: "does it take too long to become a MedCo? Can it be accelerated? If so,
            how can we accelerate the transition of staffs into MedCo?"
        </p>
        <p>A small group of 15 new staffs took on the MedCo role in their first assignment. It is of great interest to further investigate the
            profile of these 15 staffs as they did not appear to have prior experience with other operation centers or similar organizations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><b>80% of MedCo were medical professionals in their first assignment</b></h4>
        <br>
        <iframe width="500" height="500" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="charts/medco_first_assignment.html"></iframe>
        <iframe width="500" height="500" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="charts/non_medco_first_assignment.html"></iframe>
        <p>We broadly define "Medical Professionals" as "MD", "Nurse" and "GAS", "Non-medical Professionals" as "Non Medical", "Others", 'Midwife'
            and "Unknown" and "Liaison Professionals" as "MedCo", "Deputy MedCo", "MTL" and "Project Coordinator". Around 80% of the staffs who
            eventaully became a MedCos started their journey with MSF as a medical professional. On the other hand, in the group of
            staffs who did not (or have not yet) took up the MedCo role, 50% of them are non-medical professionals. It does appear that there
            is higher tendency for medical professionals to progress into MedCo role compared to non-medical professionals. This might be
            due to the nature of MedCo role which requires good level of understanding in the medical domain.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Medical professions transit into liaison roles before becoming MedCo</b></h4>
        <br>
        <iframe width="1100" height="800" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="charts/role_transistion.html"></iframe>
        <p>Around 50% of MDs and Nurses took up the role of project coordinator before taking up the MedCo role. Another 20% of MD took
            Deupty MedCo or MTL role before taking up the MedCo role. It appears that skillsets required by staffs as medical professionals
            may not be sufficient in preparing them for the MedCo role directly, hence majority of the medical professional who turns MedCo
            went through the liaison professional role to better equip themselves with necessary skillsets.
